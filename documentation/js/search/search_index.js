This library is designed to provide robust security features and simplify the implementation of authentication and access control in your applications.\nFeatures\n\nSecureAuthService: Provides authentication functionalities like login, signup, password reset, and token validation using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).\nSecureRbacService: Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user roles and permissions, allowing fine-grained control over access to resources.\nSecureUserService: Handles user management operations, including user creation, updating, deletion, activation, and deactivation.\nPrismaService: Extends PrismaClient to connect to the database securely.\nMailService: Sends emails, including password reset emails, to users.\n\nInstallation\nTo use the Secure Gates library in your NestJS application, follow these steps:\n\nInstall the library via npm or yarn:\n\nnpm install securegates# oryarn add securegates\nImport the required modules and services into your application's main module:\n\nimport { Module } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureAuthService, SecureRbacService, SecureUserService, PrismaService, MailService } from 'securegates';@Module({  imports: [...], // Other modules  providers: [SecureAuthService, SecureRbacService, SecureUserService, PrismaService, MailService],  controllers: [...], // Your application's controllers})export class AppModule {}Usage\nAuthentication (SecureAuthService)\nThe SecureAuthService provides the following authentication functionalities:\n\nLogin: Authenticate a user based on their email and password and return an access token upon successful authentication.\n\nimport { Controller, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureAuthService } from 'securegates';@Controller('auth')export class AuthController {  constructor(private readonly authService: SecureAuthService) {}  @Post('login')  async login(@Body() loginDto: LoginDto) {    const { email, password } = loginDto;    return this.authService.login(email, password);  }}\nSignup: Register a new user with the provided email and password.\n\nimport { Controller, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureAuthService } from 'securegates';@Controller('auth')export class AuthController {  constructor(private readonly authService: SecureAuthService) {}  @Post('signup')  async signup(@Body() signupDto: SignupDto) {    const { email, password } = signupDto;    return this.authService.signup(email, password);  }}\nPassword Reset: Initiate the \"Forgot Password\" flow for a user based on the provided email.\n\nimport { Controller, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureAuthService } from 'securegates';@Controller('auth')export class AuthController {  constructor(private readonly authService: SecureAuthService) {}  @Post('forgot-password')  async forgotPassword(@Body() forgotPasswordDto: ForgotPasswordDto) {    const { email } = forgotPasswordDto;    return this.authService.forgotPassword(email);  }}Role-Based Access Control (SecureRbacService)\nThe SecureRbacService provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionalities to manage user roles and permissions.\n\nCreate Role: Create a new role.\n\nimport { Controller, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureRbacService } from 'securegates';@Controller('rbac')export class RbacController {  constructor(private readonly rbacService: SecureRbacService) {}  @Post('create-role')  async createRole(@Body() createRoleDto: CreateRoleDto) {    const { name, description } = createRoleDto;    return this.rbacService.createRole(name, description);  }}\nCreate Permission: Create a new permission.\n\nimport { Controller, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureRbacService } from 'securegates';@Controller('rbac')export class RbacController {  constructor(private readonly rbacService: SecureRbacService) {}  @Post('create-permission')  async createPermission(@Body() createPermissionDto: CreatePermissionDto) {    const { name, description } = createPermissionDto;    return this.rbacService.createPermission(name, description);  }}\nAssign Role to User: Assign a role to a user.\n\nimport { Controller, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureRbacService } from 'securegates';@Controller('rbac')export class RbacController {  constructor(private readonly rbacService: SecureRbacService) {}  @Post('assign-role-to-user')  async assignRoleToUser(@Body() assignRoleToUserDto: AssignRoleToUserDto) {    const { userId, roleId } = assignRoleToUserDto;    return this.rbacService.assignRoleToUser(userId, roleId);  }}User Management (SecureUserService)\nThe SecureUserService handles user management operations.\n\nGet Users: Get all users from the database.\n\nimport { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureUserService } from 'securegates';@Controller('users')export class UserController {  constructor(private readonly userService: SecureUserService) {}  @Get()  async getUsers() {    return this.userService.getUsers();  }}\nUpdate User: Update a user's email or password.\n\nimport { Controller, Patch, Param, Body } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureUserService, UpdateUserDto } from 'securegates';@Controller('users')export class UserController {  constructor(private readonly userService: SecureUserService) {}  @Patch(':id')  async updateUser(@Param('id') id: number, @Body() updateUserDto: UpdateUserDto) {    return this.userService.updateUser(id, updateUserDto);  }}\nDelete User: Delete a user.\n\nimport { Controller, Delete, Param } from '@nestjs/common';import { SecureUserService } from 'securegates';@Controller('users')export class UserController {  constructor(private readonly userService: SecureUserService) {}  @Delete(':id')  async deleteUser(@Param('id') id: number) {    return this.userService.deleteUser(id);  }}Contribution\nContributions to the Secure Gates library are welcome!
